<h1>JavaScript Challenge</h1>
<h3>Author: Tim Lucas</h3>
<h6>WUSTL Data Analytics Bootcamp homework Week 14</h6>

<p>In this assignment we were tasked with building a webpage that can dynamically build and filter a table of data using a provided dataset and JavaScript. The web page does not refresh with form submission but dynamically loads the new results each type the form is submitted. The primary style of the HTML page and the data were both provided. The challenge was to write the JavaScript code and adjust the HTML page as needed.</p>

<h6>Level 1 - Required</h6>
<p>The level 1 directory contains the core of the assignment. This page only contains a single text input for the date. The user can manually enter a date in the format suggested and filter the results accordingly.</p>

<h6>Level 2 - Bonus</h6>
<p>The level 2 directory contains a more dynamic example of the same assignment. In this case, we are dynamically loading 4 additional select filters. There is added logic that only uses the filters that are selected and dynamically loads a sorted, unique list of values to populate the select drop-down. This is so that the user isn't wasting time selecting filters that don't exist within the entirety of the dataset but the drop-downs will also update if the data set changes at a later time.</p>
